- 👋 Hi, I'm @bettychou1993. 
I'm Fang-Yu Chou, and I go by Betty. 

- 👀 I'm a Data Scientist working in the automotive industry. I'm a team player and motivated to provide business value by applying DS/ML to real-world data.

- 🌱 I'm currently sharpening my skills in data science skills (ex: LLM) and learning Spanish.

- 💞️ In my leisure time, I love to travel, exploring different cultures and cuisines. Traveling is like reading a book to me, it's exciting and I can always learn new things. 

- 📫 You can reach me at fc332@cornell.edu.
